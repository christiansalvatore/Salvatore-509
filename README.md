This is a public dataset to be used as a benchmark in the field of automatic classification of Alzheimer's Disease.
<br>
This repository does not contain any data from patients itself. Data are taken from the <a href="http://adni.loni.usc.edu/" target="_blank">Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) public database</a>, from where they can be downloaded after registration. On the contrary, this repository consists of:
  1. IDs of patients (corresponding to the IDs of subjects in the ADNI database)
  2. Fixed splitting indexes to perform a 20-fold nested cross-validation

Using this information, data of patients can be downloaded from the ADNI platform, and used in a 20-fold nested cross-validation, thus obtaining results that can be easily compared to previously published studies.
